## Problem Statement

- There are 80 seats in a coach of a train with only 7 seats in a row and last row of only 3 seats. For simplicity, there is only one coach in this train.
- One person can reserve up to 7 seats at a time.
- If person is reserving seats, the priority will be to book them in one row.
- If seats are not available in one row then the booking should be done in such a way that the nearby seats are booked.

## Solution

- The problem scenario involves a train coach with 80 seats, arranged in rows. Each seat can be in one of two states: empty ('0') or booked ('1'). The seat status is represented by a string called "all_seats" with a **length of 80**.
- To persist the seat status, the string "all_seats" is stored in a database. This allows the program to save the changes made to the seat reservations.
- logic in code, **areSeatsAvailable()** function checks if a given row has a consecutive block of empty seats that can accommodate a specific number of seats. It takes a row of seats ($row) and the desired number of seats to be reserved ($numSeats)
- The **reserveSeats()** function is responsible for reserving seats in the train coach. It takes two parameters: the coach array ($coach) and the desired number of seats to be reserved ($numSeats).
- By storing the "all_seats" string in a database, the seat reservations can be persisted across different program runs. This allows the program to maintain the latest seat status even after restarting or closing the application.
